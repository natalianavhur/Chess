# Overview

This project is a Python program designed to simulate the game of chess. It includes features for validating moves according to the rules of chess and enabling turns gameplay, just like in a traditional match. Additionally, future extensions may introduce artificial intelligence (AI) opponents for single-player mode and other gameplay options. The program aims to deliver an engaging and interactive experience through a graphical user interface, ensuring the rules of chess are strictly followed. This allows players to enjoy a digital experience that closely resembles playing chess in its traditional form.

As a software engineer, my goal with this project is to deepen my knowledge of algorithm design, data structures, and game logic while creating a functional application for users to enjoy.This project lays a foundation for exploring advanced topics such as AI integration, machine learning, and graphical user interfaces (GUIs) in software development.
